I. Introduction
For this project, we wanted to explore whether certain rule changes would make the game of football more exciting. The changes we wanted to experiment with were as follows:
a 15 yard first down with a 5th down, disallowing field goals within 15 yards of the endzone, earning 2 points for forcing a turnover, and field goals being worth 4 points instead
of 3. We wanted to kind of compare which, if any, of these new rules would increase excitement in the game. We thought this was an interesting question to explore as we think about
how the game of football can grow and evolve for new audiences. These are all hypotheticals, of course, but we thought it would be fun and interesting to see how new rules could
change the game in a positive way, making it more exciting for viewers than it already is.

II. Methods
To test these changes in our simulation, we just made a new file for rule configurations. Within this file, there are input options for the 
different aspects we wanted to look at. We made this change because it felt the most efficient. We can turn the inputs on and off as we see 
fit, and look at the individual parameters. The function itself is just rule configurations, and we can set things like yards to gain,
field goal points, and allowance of field goals within the 15 yard line ourselves within the function, and then test the outcome.
