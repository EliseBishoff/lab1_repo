I. Introduction
For this project, we wanted to explore whether certain rule changes would make the game of football more exciting. The changes we wanted to experiment with were as follows:
a 15 yard first down with a 5th down, disallowing field goals within 15 yards of the endzone, earning 2 points for forcing a turnover, and field goals being worth 4 points instead
of 3. We wanted to kind of compare which, if any, of these new rules would increase excitement in the game. We thought this was an interesting question to explore as we think about
how the game of football can grow and evolve for new audiences. These are all hypotheticals, of course, but we thought it would be fun and interesting to see how new rules could
change the game in a positive way, making it more exciting for viewers than it already is.
